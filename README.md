# Web books initiatives

A list of different initiatives of *web books*, listed chronologically (creation dates).

## Definition of the web book concept
A web book is a book readable in a browser: a collection of organised documents, structured in parts (like chapters), with some navigation tools (like a table of contents or TOC), readable on the web. There are different levels of technological efficiency: mobile friendly (aka *responsive*), offline readable, Progressive Web Application (PWA), etc.
